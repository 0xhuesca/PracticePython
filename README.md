Exercise 1:
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Exercise 2:
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the 
user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
